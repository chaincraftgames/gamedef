/**
 * Mechanic: chaincraft:dominant-gamepiece
 * Scope: game-level
 *
 * Determines hierarchical (who-beats-whom) relationships between gamepieces in an
 * inventory and resolves an overall winner. A general comparison engine — it powers
 * trick-taking dominant gamepiece suits, "highest value wins" showdowns, and cyclic matchups like
 * Rock-Paper-Scissors.
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * The mechanic evaluates every piece currently in `evaluationInventory` by applying an
 * ordered list of `rules`. Each rule assigns a rank to every piece (rank 0 = best).
 * Rules are applied in order: the first rule partitions pieces into ranked groups, and
 * each subsequent rule breaks ties *within* a group. The piece(s) ending at rank 0 win.
 *
 * The owner of the unique rank-0 piece is written to `winnerToState` as the round winner.
 * If two or more pieces tie at rank 0 (no rule breaks the tie), the result is a draw and
 * `winnerToState` receives an empty string.
 *
 * ## Rule types (mirrors the engine's dominant-gamepiece rule kinds)
 *
 *   dominant   — one specific value beats everything else (e.g. dominant gamepiece suit, Ace-high).
 *                The dominant value may be literal or a JsonLogic expression reading
 *                game state (e.g. the dynamically declared dominant gamepiece suit).
 *   comparison — order pieces along an ordinal scale (e.g. card rank, weapon power).
 *                Highest or lowest wins.
 *   matrix     — cyclic / non-transitive relationships defined by explicit beats-lists
 *                (e.g. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock).
 *
 * Chain rules for tie-breaking, e.g. trick-taking = [dominant dominant gamepiece] → [dominant leading
 * suit] → [comparison rank highest].
 *
 * ## Integration
 *
 * ### Exposes
 *   Effects (by ref):
 *     { ref: "chaincraft:dominant-gamepiece:resolve" }            (single dominant gamepiece mechanic)
 *     { ref: "chaincraft:dominant-gamepiece:<id>:resolve" }       (when an id is set)
 *     Evaluates `evaluationInventory`, applies the rule chain, and writes the winning
 *     piece's owner to `winnerToState` (empty string on a draw). Call from flow hooks
 *     (e.g. a round's onComplete) or actions.
 *
 * ### References (does not own)
 *   inventories.ts:     `evaluationInventory` — inventory holding the pieces to compare.
 *   gamepiece-types.ts: each rule's `property` — a property on the pieces being compared.
 *   state.ts:           `winnerToState` — a string game property to receive the winner ID.
 *
 * ### Configuration
 *   Required: evaluationInventory, rules (>= 1), winnerToState
 *   Optional: id (required if >1 dominant gamepiece mechanic), label
 *
 * @example Rock-Paper-Scissors (Absurd Armaments — weapons carry a hidden `rps` property)
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:dominant-gamepiece
 * evaluationInventory: arena
 * winnerToState: game.property.roundWinner
 * rules:
 *   - kind: matrix
 *     property: rps
 *     beats:
 *       rock: [scissors]
 *       paper: [rock]
 *       scissors: [paper]
 * ```
 * @example Spades (dominant suit beats all; ties broken by rank)
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:dominant-gamepiece
 * evaluationInventory: trick-pile
 * winnerToState: game.property.trickWinner
 * rules:
 *   - kind: dominant
 *     property: suit
 *     dominantValue: spades
 *   - kind: comparison
 *     property: rank
 *     order: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A]
 *     direction: highest
 * ```
 * @example Euchre (dominant declared during bidding — read dynamically from game state)
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:dominant-gamepiece
 * evaluationInventory: trick-pile
 * winnerToState: game.property.trickWinner
 * rules:
 *   - kind: dominant
 *     property: suit
 *     dominantValue: { var: "game.property.declaredDominant" }
 *   - kind: comparison
 *     property: rank
 *     order: [9, 10, J, Q, K, A]
 *     direction: highest
 * ```
 * @example Highest value wins (simple showdown, no dominant)
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:dominant-gamepiece
 * evaluationInventory: showdown
 * winnerToState: game.property.roundWinner
 * rules:
 *   - kind: comparison
 *     property: power
 *     direction: highest
 * ```
