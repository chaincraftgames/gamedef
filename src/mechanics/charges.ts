/**
 * Mechanic: chaincraft:charges
 * Scope: piece-level
 *
 * Gates an action behind a resource cost drawn from a piece's own inventory.
 *
 * ## Integration
 *
 * ### Exposes
 *   Action slots:  <slotId>
 *     The gated slot ID. Referenced in flow node availableActions[] and piece type
 *     actionSlots[] exactly like any explicit slot. Do NOT also declare it in
 *     actionSlots[] — the mechanic creates it.
 *   Inventories:   "chaincraft:charges:<slotId>:charges"   (mechanic-owned)
 *     Piece-scoped inventory holding charge tokens. Not in inventorySlots[].
 *     Setup effects fill it via game:unassigned before play begins.
 *
 * ### References
 *   actions.ts:   `action`              — action ID executed when the slot fires
 *   flow.ts:      `availableInSubflows` — optional subflow node IDs restricting availability
 *
 * ### Properties defined
 *   (none — charge count is tracked through the injected inventory, not a named property)
 *
 * ### Configuration
 *   Required: slotId, chargeType, maxCharges, count, action
 *   Optional: label, depleteTo (default: "game:unassigned"), availableInSubflows
 *
 * ## Engine synthesis
 *   1. Precondition: piece.inventory["chaincraft:charges:<slotId>:charges"].count >= count
 *   2. An action slot (<slotId>) that executes the referenced action's full effect list
 *   3. Post-execution cleanup: move `count` tokens from charge inventory → depleteTo
 *
 * The referenced action is declared normally in the actions module and may be used in
 * other contexts without the charge gate — the mechanic is purely additive.
 *
 * Composition with chaincraft:conversion: declare conversion first with its own slotId,
 * then reference that slotId as charges.action. Do NOT wire the conversion slot into
 * flow directly — only the charges slot is player-accessible. The engine resolves the
 * conversion action internally through the charges gate.
 *
 * The mechanic OWNS the charge inventory slot. Do NOT declare it in the piece type's
 * inventorySlots[].
 *
 * @example Creature card that can spend 2 energy counters to convert resources
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:charges
 * slotId: mygame:energy-ability
 * label: Energy Ability
 * chargeType: energy-counter        # gamepiece type for the charge tokens (mechanic owns type)
 * maxCharges: 3                     # capacity of the injected charge inventory
 * count: 2                          # tokens consumed per activation
 * action: convert-ore-to-gold       # action ID in the actions module
 * depleteTo: game:unassigned        # where spent charges go (default)
 * availableInSubflows: [action-phase]
 * ```
 * @example Card that exhausts itself (1 charge, refilled by another action)
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:charges
 * slotId: mygame:tap-ability
 * chargeType: readiness-token
 * maxCharges: 1
 * count: 1
 * action: deal-damage
 * depleteTo: game:unassigned
 * ```
