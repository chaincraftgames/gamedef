/**
 * Mechanic: chaincraft:score-track
 * Scope: game-level
 *
 * Tracks player or team scores on a line-structure inventory.
 *
 * ## Integration
 *
 * ### Exposes
 *   Inventories:     "chaincraft:score-track:<id>:track"    (mechanic-owned)
 *     Game-scoped line inventory of length trackLength. Not in inventories module.
 *   Gamepiece types: "chaincraft:score-track:<id>:marker"   (mechanic-owned)
 *     Score marker piece — one instance per player or team. Not in gamepiece-types.
 *   Effects (by ref):
 *     { ref: "chaincraft:score-track:<id>:advance", params: { delta: N } }
 *     Moves the actor's marker N positions forward. Call from actions or flow hooks
 *     whenever a player/team scores points.
 *   Setup effect (auto-injected):
 *     Places one marker per player/team at position 0 in root loop's onEnter.
 *   End condition (auto-wired when winAt is set):
 *     Exits the root flow loop when any marker reaches winAt.
 *
 * ### References
 *   players.ts:    `scoringProperty`  — must match a property declared on the player/team.
 *     The engine keeps this property in sync with the marker position. Readable via
 *     JsonLogic: { var: "actor.property.<scoringProperty>" }
 *
 * ### Properties defined
 *   On player (scope: "player") or team (scope: "team"):
 *     <scoringProperty>  — integer, kept in sync with marker position by the engine.
 *     Forward reference: declare this property in the players module.
 *
 * ### Configuration
 *   Required: trackLength, scoringProperty, scope
 *   Optional: id (required if >1 track), label, winAt, finalRound (default: false)
 *
 * ## Engine synthesis
 *   1. A game-scoped line inventory for the track (length: trackLength)
 *   2. A score marker gamepiece type (one per player or team)
 *   3. An `advance` effect callable by ref (see Exposes above)
 *   4. Setup move: places markers at position 0 in root loop onEnter
 *   5. Optional end condition on root loop when winAt is set
 *
 * @example Simple 10-point track (Tic-tac-toe variant)
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:score-track
 * id: main-score
 * trackLength: 10
 * scoringProperty: score
 * scope: player
 * winAt: 10
 * ```
 * @example Catan-style victory points (no physical track, just property sync)
 * ```yaml
 * kind: chaincraft:score-track
 * id: vp-track
 * trackLength: 15
 * scoringProperty: victoryPoints
 * scope: player
 * winAt: 10
 * finalRound: true       # all players finish current round after someone hits 10
 * ```
 * @example Two tracks — score + morale (no win condition on morale)
 * ```yaml
 * - kind: chaincraft:score-track
 *   id: score-track
 *   trackLength: 20
 *   scoringProperty: score
 *   scope: player
 *   winAt: 20
 *   finalRound: true
 * - kind: chaincraft:score-track
 *   id: morale-track
 *   trackLength: 10
 *   scoringProperty: morale
 *   scope: team
 * ```
