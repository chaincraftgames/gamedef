/**
 * Effects Module Schema
 *
 * No dependencies on other spec modules — inventory type IDs, gamepiece type IDs,
 * and property IDs are all string forward references validated cross-section.
 * Referenced by: actions (action.effects), flow (phase-transition effects),
 *                mechanics (pattern execution effects).
 *
 * Effects are named, concrete state-transition operations. Named effects live in the
 * effects module and are always fully self-contained — no parameters, no binding maps.
 * Call sites (actions, flow transitions, mechanics) reference them by ID.
 *
 * Inline effects may be used at any call site for one-off transitions not worth naming.
 * Inline effects inside actions may use { param: id } in PropertyValue to reference a
 * value from the enclosing action's inputs[] — the engine resolves these by convention
 * without any explicit binding declaration.
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - Every effect is discriminated by 'kind' — a discriminated union, not a catch-all map.
 * - Named effects are concrete and reusable. Use them for anything triggered from more
 *   than one place (an action AND a flow transition, or an action AND a mechanic).
 * - Inline effects are anonymous and local. Use them for one-off transitions specific
 *   to a single action or flow step.
 * - { param: id } in PropertyValue is only valid in inline effects inside an action that
 *   declares a matching input id. The engine resolves by name — no bind map needed.
 * - 'custom' kind is the escape hatch for logic that doesn't fit the primitive kinds.
 *   Avoid overusing it — the primitive kinds cover the common cases deterministically.
 * - PieceSelector is shared across move/flip/update/roll/orient. Deterministic only:
 *   player choice is declared as an action input (gamepiece-select), not an effect selector.
 * - draw-discard behavior is a MECHANIC that references effects — not a special kind.
 *
 * @example Effects module (card game)
 * ```yaml
 * effects:
 *   - id: shuffle-deck
 *     kind: shuffle
 *     inventory: draw-deck
 *
 *   - id: draw-card
 *     kind: move
 *     from: { inventory: draw-deck, select: top }
 *     to: { inventory: player-hand }
 *
 *   - id: advance-score-2
 *     kind: update
 *     pieces: { inventory: score-track, select: all, ofType: score-peg }
 *     property: position
 *     value: { delta: 2 }
 *
 *   - id: resolve-combat
 *     kind: custom
 *     description: >
 *       Compare power totals of face-up cards. Higher total scores 1 point.
 *       On a tie no points scored; both players draw a card.
 * ```
 * @example Action with inline effects using { param } (Liar's Dice make-bid)
 * ```yaml
 * id: make-bid
 * pattern: standard
 * inputs:
 *   - id: quantity
 *     type: { kind: integer, min: 1, max: 30 }
 *   - id: face-value
 *     type: { kind: integer, min: 1, max: 6 }
 * effects:
 *   # { param: quantity } resolves from this action's inputs[] by id — no bind map
 *   - kind: update
 *     pieces: { inventory: current-bid, select: top }
 *     property: quantity
 *     value: { param: quantity }
 *   - kind: update
 *     pieces: { inventory: current-bid, select: top }
 *     property: face-value
 *     value: { param: face-value }
 * ```
 * @example Mixed named refs and inline in a single action
 * ```yaml
 * effects:
 *   - ref: shuffle-deck
 *   - kind: move
 *     from: { inventory: draw-deck, select: top }
 *     to: { inventory: player-hand }
 * ```

 *
 * Mirrors game-builder's image-generation functions:
 *   - mode 'described' → generateImageWithDescription(contextText, templateVars, config):
 *       an LLM first writes an image description from the `source` property, then the
 *       preset's prompt template renders it.
 *   - mode 'direct' → generateImageDirect(templateVars, config):
 *       `templateVars` are injected straight into the preset's prompt template, no
 *       description step.
 * The `imageType` selects the engine's preset config (model, dimensions, prompt
 * template, optional description system prompt, negative prompt) by name — the same
 * way `image_type` selects a preset today.
 *
 * @example Generate weapon art from its description (Absurd Armaments)
 * ```yaml
 * id: illustrate-weapon
 * kind: generate-gamepiece-image
 * pieces: { inventory: forge, select: top }
 * imageType: token
 * mode: described
 * source: description
 * target: imageUrl

 * @example Direct render from template variables (no description step)
 * ```yaml
 * id: render-card

 * pieces: { inventory: arsenal, select: top }
 * imageType: token

 * - Contains attenuate or cancel-effect → fires before the trigger resolves (intercept)
 * - Contains only regular effects → fires after the trigger resolves (reaction)
 *
 * Scope determines when the passive fires relative to the piece/role owner:
 * - owner-targeted: trigger effect targets the owner (defensive — armor, healing amp)
 * - owner-originated: owner is the actor executing the trigger (offensive — power strike)
 *
 * Enablement conditions (gamepiece passives only, ignored for role passives):
 * - enabledIn: which inventories the piece must be in for the passive to be enabled
 * - exhaustedFilter: "any" | "ready-only" | "exhausted-only"
 * - faceFilter: "any" | "face-up-only" | "face-down-only"
 *
 * @example Reduce all incoming damage by 2 while on battlefield (defensive)
