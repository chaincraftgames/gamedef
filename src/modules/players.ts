/**
 * Players Module Schema
 *
 * Forward references (string-typed here, resolved by cross-section validator):
 *   - RoleAssignmentTiming "subflow-start".subflowId → flow module node IDs
 *   - RoleAssignment "condition".condition → prose that may reference inventory
 *     names, player state fields, and gamepiece properties (e.g., "player
 *     holding the king token", "player with fewest coins in their treasury")
 *
 * Referenced by: flow (role conditions, eligiblePlayers), actions (targets),
 *                effects (role-based targeting).
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - Players can hold multiple roles simultaneously at runtime.
 * - Assignment METHOD and assignment TIMING are independent axes.
 * - The reserved role id "incapacitated" has engine-level semantics: players
 *   holding this role are automatically excluded from sub-flow participation.
 *   Games that need player elimination define this role (method: "effect") rather
 *   than setting a boolean flag.
 *
 * TODO (revisit): NFT-gated roles — a player may only be eligible to choose a
 *   role if they own a particular NFT (e.g., a character card earned in a
 *   previous game). Currently modeled as method: "player-choice" where the
 *   eligible options are filtered by the player's persistent-token inventory.
 *   No schema change needed today, but the choice-phase flow and the
 *   persistent-tokens module will need to express this eligibility constraint
 *   explicitly when those modules are designed.
